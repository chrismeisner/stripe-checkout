		<h1>How We Work</h1>
		<p>At our core, we believe that <strong>speed and focus</strong> drive innovation. In a fast-moving world, we know that the longer a project takes, the more complexity it gathers—and complexity often dilutes the clarity of vision. That’s why we follow a disciplined, sprint-based process that guarantees results in a fixed timeframe, ensuring you get exactly what you need, when you need it.</p>

		<h2>Parkinson’s Law: Why Time Matters</h2>
		<p>We design our process around a fundamental principle: <strong>work expands to fill the time available</strong>. Left unchecked, projects can stretch indefinitely, gathering unnecessary layers of complexity. Instead, we structure every project with clear deadlines and predefined timeframes to avoid this trap. By setting clear boundaries, we focus on what matters most: <strong>delivering high-impact results quickly and efficiently.</strong></p>

		<h2>Our 3-Week Sprint Model</h2>
		<p>Each project follows a carefully designed <strong>3-week sprint</strong> model. This isn’t just a deadline—it’s a framework that pushes us to be decisive, prioritize what’s essential, and create meaningful results. Here's how we do it:</p>

		<article>
			<h3>Week 1: Up the Hill (Problem Finding)</h3>
			<p>We start by defining the challenge, exploring all angles, and identifying key unknowns. In this phase, we immerse ourselves in the problem space, aligning with your goals and finding clarity on what needs to be solved. This is where our strategic insight comes into play—ensuring we don’t just execute blindly, but solve the right problem from the start.</p>
		</article>

		<article>
			<h3>Week 2: Reaching the Top (Solution Development)</h3>
			<p>By the second week, we’ve mapped the problem. Now, it’s about narrowing down the ideas and moving toward execution. We refine the strategy, explore design options, and start building out core components. The key to this phase? <strong>Focus.</strong> We eliminate distractions and unnecessary complexity to bring clarity to the solution.</p>
		</article>

		<article>
			<h3>Week 3: Down the Hill (Execution and Handoff)</h3>
			<p>With the hard part behind us, we focus on polishing, testing, and delivering the final result. Whether it's a design, a functional prototype, or a fully developed landing page, this week is about bringing everything together and making sure it’s ready to perform in the real world.</p>

		<h2>Iteration Over Perfection</h2>
		<p>We understand that no project is ever truly "finished." That’s why our approach is built around the idea of <strong>iteration, not perfection</strong>. Each sprint delivers a functional, high-quality product, but we also offer <strong>monthly iteration support</strong> to keep your project evolving. Whether it’s small tweaks, updates, or minor improvements, we handle it asynchronously, ensuring your project stays current without slowing you down.</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>Why Time-Boxed Sprints Work</h2>
		<p>Our sprint-based approach works because it forces decisions, cuts through unnecessary complexity, and drives focus. Here's why:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Clarity Through Constraints:</strong> Limiting time forces us—and you—to prioritize what matters most.</li>
			<li><strong>No Scope Creep:</strong> With a fixed sprint, the deliverable is clearly defined, preventing endless revisions and expansions.</li>
			<li><strong>Efficiency and Speed:</strong> With a clear deadline, we work with precision, knowing that efficiency doesn’t mean cutting corners—it means getting the essentials right.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>In the world of startups, time is often your most valuable asset. Our approach ensures that you maximize that time by working smart, not hard.</p>

	<section>
		<h2>The Power of Focus</h2>
		<p>At the heart of our philosophy is the belief that <strong>focus creates momentum</strong>. By limiting time and concentrating on core goals, we create results that are both powerful and actionable. We don’t get bogged down in unnecessary complexity. Instead, we simplify, clarify, and deliver. Whether it’s strategy, design, or development, our work is guided by the principle that <strong>less is often more.</strong></p>

	<section>
		<h2>How Monthly Iteration Support Fits In</h2>
		<p>Your project doesn’t stop after a sprint. We offer <strong>monthly iteration support</strong> to ensure ongoing improvements and updates. Managed 100% asynchronously through Trello, we handle minor adjustments, design tweaks, and revisions without bogging you down in meetings. Need a sync? We’re available on Mondays and Fridays to review progress and plan the next steps.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Asynchronous Workflows:</strong> All tasks are tracked via Trello, allowing for seamless communication without the need for constant back-and-forth.</li>
			<li><strong>Fast Turnaround:</strong> Tasks are handled within 24-48 hours, so nothing is left hanging.</li>
			<li><strong>Flexible Syncs:</strong> Optional Monday and Friday syncs keep the project on track without overloading your schedule.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>How We Keep You Involved</h2>
		<p>While we work quickly and efficiently, <strong>collaboration</strong> is still key to our process. Here’s how we keep you engaged without overwhelming you:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Regular Check-Ins:</strong> You’ll know exactly where we are at every stage of the sprint. We provide updates and ask for feedback at key milestones.</li>
			<li><strong>Trello Task Management:</strong> All project tasks are managed transparently via Trello, so you can see what’s being worked on and where things stand.</li>
			<li><strong>Focus on Results:</strong> Every step we take is aimed at delivering a final, functional result by the end of the sprint. No distractions, no unnecessary add-ons—just what your startup needs to move forward.</li>
		</ul>
